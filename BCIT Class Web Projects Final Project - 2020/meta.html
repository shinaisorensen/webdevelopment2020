            <!-- Site map - planned architecture -->
            <section>
                <h3>Site Map</h3>

                <p>To view the planned architecture of the new site, please <a href='/students/ssorensen23/sitemap.html'>click here</a>.</p>
                <p>
                    The structure has been created to reflect the changes and updates made for this project. The content of each 
                    page has been changed to group together the topics of each lecture, which will make it easier for search engines 
                    to view. The navigation bar will serve as a hub for all of the necessary links on the page, to all the lectures, 
                    resources and information that exist on the site.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Global changes shared for every page -->
            <section>
                <h3>Global</h3>

                <p>
                    On a global scale, changes were made to increase user accessibility, decrease browser speed and establish forward compatiblity for 
                    updates in order to increase user traffic and improve user experience. Students are the primary users of these webpages so it is important
                    that any student is able to access the site on a variety of devices and that they can access the information quickly and efficiently to 
                    help them with their studies.
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Pages will now use the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language(HTML) - HTML5:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Compatible with most browsers, easier for users to access site.</li>
                            <li>Simpler than previous versions, decreases amount of code required and improves browser speed.</li>
                            <li>New elements provided by HTML5 are easier for search engines to recognize, pages are more likely to appear in search results.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Pages will also include one global pre-processor Syntatically Awesome Style Sheet (SASS) to write CSS3 style sheet:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allows values (one or multiple) to be stored as variables, decreases repeat code and improves browser speed.</li>
                            <li>Contains a variety of features not included in regular style sheets, ensures forward compatiblity for future changes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Pages now include media queries for mobile and tablet devices:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increases user traffic as content is well-styled and formatted for each type of device.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Media query for printers is now included:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Instead of including every part of the website, only the important information (the title of the page 
                                and the course notes) will be available for users to print.
                            </li>
                            <li>Decreases the amount of pages of content that will print, saving the user resources.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Re-styled the layout and changed the colour scheme:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pages are more accessible, easier to accomodate the variety of users on the site.</li>
                            <li>Colour scheme helps make the site stand out among BCIT's web pages, refreshing for students studying from the notes online.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Changes to the header -->
            <section>
                <h3>Header</h3>

                <p>
                    Changes to the header involved storing the basic structure and content into a separate file and removing or re-locating links.
                    This helps to increase user accessibility, decrease browser loading time and direct the user to focus more on the main content.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Structure and content for header stored in a PHP file:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Decreases the amount of repeated code as every page requires the header, contributes to increased browser speed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Removed links to other BCIT pages and other class sections:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Links to other class sections are redundant, content for each class is similar and if a wrong link is clicked, 
                                users can instead click on the BCIT logo in the header to view all course sections.
                            </li>
                            <li>Links to other BCIT pages moved to navigation bar, easier to access than previous location to increase user accessibility.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Removed page title and grouped with main content, easier for search engines to locate associated content.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Changes to navigation bar -->
            <section>
                <h3>Navigation</h3>

                <p>
                    Navigation bar is now in a fixed position on screen and contains links for each page on the site, including links to other 
                    BCIT pages and resources. Redundant links and features have also been removed to help improve user experience and accessibility.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Structure and content for the navigation bar stored in a PHP file:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Decreases the amount of repeated code as every page requires the header.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Navigation bar re-located beside main content, easier to access every page on site.</li>
                    <li>Links to lectures no longer in drop-down menu, every link displayed inside navigation bar:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clicking original drop-down menu an unnecessary step, displaying all lectures increases user accessibility.</li>
                            <li>
                                Displaying all links to lecture replaces the 'Top of Page' link in footer, users can access pages more 
                                quickly from any part of the main content.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Link to home page of course moved inside navigation bar:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Easier to access than previous location at the top-left of screen, increasing user accessibility.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Navigation bar is now in a fixed position on screen:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users can access any part of the site from any location in the main content, improves user experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Changes to main content -->
            <section>
                <h3>Main Content</h3>

                <p>
                    The main layout of the page no longer has the main content use the entire space, decreasing the amount of 
                    white space and allowing the navigation bar to be more accessible. HTML5 semantics are an important addition 
                    to increase search engine optimization and therefore be more likely to appear in search results which can increase 
                    user traffic.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Content divided into sections tags with appropriate headings using HTML5:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increases search engine optimization.</li>
                        <li>Better organization of information, future updates are easier to manage in the backend.</li>
                        <li>Headings for each section are more visibly distinct, easier for users to follow content.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        Page space is allocated for the navigation bar, main content no longer produces as much white space, 
                        increasing user experience.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Changes to footer -->
            <section>
                <h3>Footer</h3>

                <p>
                    Featured links in the footer were removed along with the footer as they are 
                    redundant or hardly used. Decreases the amount of code needed per page to help 
                    increase browser speed and deliver content to users quickly and efficiently.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Removed the footer - unnecessary links:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                'Top of Page' link is no longer required as the navigation bar displays 
                                every page, link is redundant.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                'Validate HTML' link is not useful, validates the current page's HTML which is 
                                not important for the curriculum.
                            </li>
