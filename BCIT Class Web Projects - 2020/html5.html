            <h1>My Trip to Japan</h1>
            <p>It was always a dream of mine to visit Japan, and in 2018 I made that dream a reality.
                I left school to take a break from studying and worked as a barista for over a year.
                During that time I saved up money each month until I had enough to travel to Japan for
                two weeks. The experience was incredible, I visited so many wonderful sites and saw
                so many beautiful things. Let me tell you all about it!  
            </p>

            <h2>Osaka</h2>
            <p>The best place in Osaka was definitely the Owl Cafe! They have lots of owls that you can 
                interact with, take pictures with and even pet them. I was fortunate to come at a slow time
                and had most of the cafe to myself.
            </p>

                <figcaption>I can still feel the feathers on my cheek, the little owl was pretty tired.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/html5Images/osaka/whiteOwl.jpg'>
                <figcaption>They named this one Snowy because she was from Canada. Who knew I'd be meeting
                    a Canadian owl in Japan?

            <figure>
                <img src='images/html5Images/osaka/grayOwl.jpg'>
                <figcaption>This one looked at me pretty funny. I lost a staring contest with it...at least
                    it posed for the picture with me
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <hr>

            <p>This was a great city, the only thing bad was that the owls in the cafe were all tied to wooden posts.</p>

            <h2>Kyoto</h2>
            <p>The second place I was visited was Kyoto, where a store famous for dyeing their cloth with
                indigo was located. While I was there the owners of the store/company let me into their
                house/store where they sat me down and explained the history of their company. Did you
                know that fire-fighters back in the day used to wear indigo-dyed clothing soaked in water
                when going into the fire? This is because true indigo dye doesn't burn!
            </p>

                <figcaption>The front of the store, you can see all of the clothes are dyed with indigo.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/html5Images/kyoto/tonkatsu.jpg' class='rotatedPicture'>
                <figcaption>Recommended by the owners of the indigo store, tonkatsu is a deep fried pork cutlet.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <hr>

            <p>Kyoto was the best, in my opinion. Great food and great sights.</p>

        <!-- Third city description -->
        <section>
            <h2>Tokyo</h2>
            <p>The last city I was able to visit was Tokyo, which is definitely the biggest city I have ever
                been to (so far). The transit system there is incredibly complicated but with enough English
                signs so that even I could navigate them! Only had to ask for directions once.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/html5Images/tokyo/maidCafeSundae.jpg' class='rotatedPicture'>
                <figcaption>I went to a maid cafe and was called 'Princess'. My maid's name was Lettuce.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/html5Images/tokyo/hotpot.jpg' class='rotatedPicture'>
                <figcaption>Another favourtie dish of mine, for $25 there were four kinds of meat (bottomless) and
                    all-you-can eat veggie bar. I went a couple times because the food was so worth it for the price.
                </figcaption>

            <figure>
                <img src='images/html5Images/tokyo/dango.jpg' class='rotatedPicture'>
                <figcaption>One of my favourite desserts, dango is a rice cake that has been coated in a sweet
                    syrup. It kind of tasted like very sweet soy sauce. The side dish was rice cakes coated in
                    soy bean flour.

            <p>I wish Tokyo wasn't so expensive, a great city with great people though.</p>
