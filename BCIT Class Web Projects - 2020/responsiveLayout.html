            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Radiant Historia</em> is a brilliant game for the Nintendo 3DS that you could play originally on the Nintendo DS.
                On the continent of Vainqueur are two main kingdoms, Alistel and Granorg, who are at war because Alistel believes 
                that Granorg is responsible for the desertification happening around the world. This phenomenon is draining living things 
                of their life source, Mana, and turning them into sand.
            </p>
            <p>
                The story is about a man named Stocke who is a spy working for the country of Alistel who is sent to the 
                capital city to escort an agent with intel on the enemy country, Granorg. Before leaving with his subordinates
                Marco and Raynie, he's given a book called the "White Chronicle" from his superior, Heiss. The group are ambushed
                by enemy soldiers sent from Granorg and the spy is killed. During the fight, both Marco and Raynie sacrifice
                themselves to ensure Stocke's safety, but he becomes trapped on a bridge and left to fight. He barely manages
                to escape with grievous wounds after jumping off the bridge. He finds himself in what seems to be another world.
                There, two children named Lippti and Teo tell him that the realm is called Historia and that it is separate from
                time itself. Using the power of Historia through the White Chronicle, he will be able to travel back and forth 
                through time. Stocke uses the power of Historia to travel back in time, saving Marco and Raynie and making the 
                mission a success! However, moving forward he must navigate two very different timelines in order to find a way 
                to stop the war and find out the real truth behind why the war happened.

            <h2>What I Liked About It</h2>
            <p>
                I loved this game, the storyline and characters had me invested from day one. Stocke is very stoic, 
                but cares for his comrades and eventually I did too. Any bad ending where you lose a character had me go back in 
                time to try and save them, no matter how many times I had to jump through the timeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many side-quests scattered throughout the continent and many involve jumping through time in order to 
                solve them. I'd never had to try and complete quests this way, so I appreciated the unique game-play. Sometimes 
                it was difficult to figure out which timeline and which moment was the key to moving forward in the story. Once 
                I was able to figure it out, I always felt accomplished, especially because finding the solution was sometimes 
                incredibly tedious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thoroughly enjoyed the battle system as well, every character good and evil gets a turn which you can link for 
                combos. I was able to take my time and plan out each attack, making sure I'd have enough health to survive the 
                onslaught of all my enemies turns as well. Some of the boss fights see you up against a giant spider that takes 
                up the entire board! Some of the boss fights were incredibly emotional and I'd never felt such emotion for any 
                game before this. I definitely cried near the ending after I found out the truth of the war and the desertification.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find the trailer for the newest version of the game <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSng9jvTo4o'>here</a>

            <h2>What Could Be Improved</h2>
            <p>
                If there's only one thing that I'd have to take issue with, it would be that leveling up can be tedious.
                You only get so many experience points per battle and trying to level up all of your characters near the end of the 
                game can be difficult. Most enemies don't give out that many points and you have to make sure you've been rotating 
                all of your party members as there are many side-quests that require each character to be at a certain level. This
                wouldn't be a problem if you wanted the normal ending, but that ending would leave you unsatisfied. If you want the 
                true ending, although it's bittersweet, you'd have to make sure that every side-quest is complete and therefore all 
                of your characters must be levelled up enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully if you are able to get your hands on the newest version for the Nintendo 3DS, <em>Radiant Historia: 
                Perfect Chronology</em> there is an item in the store that's part of a DLC (downloadable content) for only a dollar(ish) 
                that can help make grinding for levels much easier.

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                If you have the funds and you have the time, trying this game is a must! I always recommend it to anyone
                looking for something to play because it has become very dear to me. Nothing can take away the fond memories I have of
                being blown away by the uniqueness of this game. Many of the games moments were incredibly emotional and I really wanted 
                to see all of the characters, whether main or on the side, succeed in their own quests.
            </p>
            <p>
                One last thing, near the end of the game I wasn't at a high-enough level to beat the last boss. I had completed every
                side-quest and unlocked every bad ending so that I could see the true ending and all the happy endings.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the original game, I tried to level up using cheat codes and promptly lost all of my data. I did not play the game after
                that for a couple years. Then I picked it up when I was less mad at it and myself, played through the game again, completed
                everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                And lost all of my data again.
            </p>
            <p>
                I bought the newest version for the Nintendo 3DS and practically threw my money at the store to buy the ring that would help
                my characters level up.
            </p>
            <p>
                I waited seven years to see the best ending, and it was totally worth it. Thankfully, you won't have to wait as long.
